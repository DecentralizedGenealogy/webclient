    <h3>The DDT is a place where...</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>No enforcement of referential integrity. The client could implement a soft version of ref integrity. If you remove a child from a parent, the child may still maintain relationship to parent.</li>
    	<li>No garuentee a relationship link won't become 404.</li>
    	<li>No central authority or control of the tree.</li>
    	<li>The tree is distributed geographically and authoritatively.</li>
    	<li>Each person or node in the tree is autonomous.</li>
    	<li>tree data is open and available to all.</li>
    	<li>Anyone can suggest (pull request) a change.</li>
    	<li>Everyone has freedom to fork a node if concensus is not met.</li>
    	<li>Combined with IPFS the nodes themselves also become decentralized and distributed.</li>
    	<li>Un-authenticated reading of tree. (The client could allow authentication for trees such as Ancestry, FamilySearch, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Looking for volunteers to help with...</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>A search engine utilizing github webhooks to update the search index.</li>
    	<li>A web and/or electron client</li>
    	<li>A tree hosting service (gitlab might be a good start)</li>
    </ul>
